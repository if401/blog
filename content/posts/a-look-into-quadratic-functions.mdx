A quadratic function is a type of polynomial function that is defined by a quadratic equation. The general form of a quadratic function is:

$$
f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
$$

where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants with \(a \neq 0\). The variable \(x\) is the independent variable, and \(f(x)\) represents the value of the function at \(x\).

## Key Characteristics

### 1. **Parabola Shape**

The graph of a quadratic function is a parabola. Depending on the sign of \(a\):

- If \(a > 0\), the parabola opens upwards (U-shaped).
- If \(a < 0\), the parabola opens downwards (âˆ©-shaped).

### 2. **Vertex**

The vertex of the parabola is the highest or lowest point, depending on the direction it opens. The vertex can be found using the formula:

$$
x = -\frac{b}{2a}
$$

To find the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex, substitute \(x\) back into the quadratic function:

$$
y = f\left(-\frac{b}{2a}\right)
$$

So, the vertex is at $$ \left(-\frac{b}{2a}, f\left(-\frac{b}{2a}\right)\right) $$.

### 3. **Axis of Symmetry**

The axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex of the parabola. It has the equation:

$$
x = -\frac{b}{2a}
$$

### 4. **Y-Intercept**

The y-intercept is the point where the parabola crosses the y-axis. It occurs when \(x = 0\). For the quadratic function $$ f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c $$, the y-intercept is:

$$
f(0) = c
$$

### 5. **X-Intercepts (Roots)**

The x-intercepts are the points where the parabola crosses the x-axis. They can be found by solving the quadratic equation $$ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $$ using the quadratic formula:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

where $$ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac $$ is called the discriminant. The nature of the roots is determined by the discriminant:

- If $$ \Delta > 0 $$, there are two distinct real roots.
- If $$ \Delta = 0 $$, there is exactly one real root (the vertex is on the x-axis).
- If $$ \Delta < 0 $$, there are no real roots (the parabola does not intersect the x-axis).

## Example

Consider the quadratic function:

$$
f(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 1
$$

- **Vertex**: Use $$ x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{-4}{2 \cdot 2} = 1 $$

  - Substitute \(x = 1\) into $$ f(x) $$:
    $$ f(1) = 2(1)^2 - 4(1) + 1 = -1 $$
  - Vertex: $$ (1, -1) $$

- **Axis of Symmetry**: $$ x = 1 $$

- **Y-Intercept**: $$ f(0) = 1 $$

- **X-Intercepts**: Solve $$ 2x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0 $$ using the quadratic formula:
  $$ x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 8}}{4} $$

  $$ = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{8}}{4} = \frac{4 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{4} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

  So, the x-intercepts are $$ x = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} $$ and $$ x = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} $$
